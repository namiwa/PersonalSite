# What are transistors?
Transistors are the smallest unit of computing possible, thus far. Harnessing
the phyiscal properties of certain metallic-like rocks, we are able to create
very small switches which are able to remember their state. Just like how a
regular mechanic switch is able to remain on or off until a person comes along
to press it to change its shape, transistors are essentially electrical switches,
sole operating on either current or voltage. 

By fabricating these switches into sizes smaller then the width of a human hair,
we are able to pack an insane number of them into a vary small volume of area.
The proliferation of handheld technology from the late 80s to now was in part
possible due to massive leaps in shrinking transistors sizes from the sizes of 
lightbulbs, to close to the sies of molecules and atoms.
