<h4> Have you owned any piece of electronics for 9 years? </h4>

Clearly, it something quite unique to be able to own something for so long, and have it not break on you. It really is quite a feat for something to be chugging along day in and day out without much breaking, and still able to be productive on some level.

I am of course talking about my desktop gaming PC, where its been going strong since December of 2014. My first gaming PC so far, and almost of the past decade it had been with me through ups and downs and thick and thin.

What struck me was that by running minimal maintance, and not doing anything silly, these products can live well past their rated warranty of 2 - 5 years if we follow basic hardware repair methods. And when diagnosing issues for hardware, it can always be a daunting challenge, since we might have no idea what is the root cause of the system failure.

Here are my go to tips for diagnosing traditional desktop PC. As always, before doing any form of self maintainance, you must ensure that you know the risks of handling sensitive electronics, such as grounding yourself appropiately and being very careful of tearing or touching components such as capacitors or otherwise.

1. Always consult the motherboard's manual for bootcode errors & led indicators. Sometimes, these built-in indicators can diagnose such boot problems in seconds without much issues. Another way to know is via boot code beeps reference in the mother board manual as well. And as always, ensure that you are referencing the latest digital copy of the motherboard which you have on hand.

2. Reseat and remounted components first. Usual targets for these are RAM, GPU and any data drives connected to the mother board.

3. Clear the system timer to prevent any cached boot errors from remaining in the system. Follow the specific instructions on the motherboard for doing so, which usually invovles reseating some jumpers temporarily on the motherboard.

4. Reseat the system timer to make sure that the system timer is fully flushed.

Usually doing these steps and hopfully resolve any issues relating to a previously functional desktop PC. Of course, running on stock settings and running year / bi-yearly maintainance helps with the overall longetivity of the system, so here's are some tips for that as well!

* Make sure to place desktop in a location where there's sufficient airflow if possible so that the system is able to take in air and exhaust air properly.

* Cleaning the fans of dust using canned air is one of the easiest way to ensure that the system will not have any build up of dust which can hamper thermal performance and longetivity.
